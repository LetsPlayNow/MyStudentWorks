# MyStudentWorks
Some of my student works that seemed interesting to me.
The quality of the code varies greatly because there are many works from differerent academic years.
Latest works were not included.

## In Works folder you can see 2 really big works
### 3D Scanning
This work was a great way from experiments with stereo maching from OpenCV to finishing  
project for restoration objects point cloud quality   
(fill holes, find contours of objects in cloud) with `Processing` language.  

### CPU
This is my own CPU project, which actually doesn't works as expected.  
I think that problem in microcommand architecture.

## In Study Works
There are you can see labs or semester works from different years or semesters.  
I deleted almost all binary data (libraries, .exe, .so, etc.) to make this archive lightweight.
